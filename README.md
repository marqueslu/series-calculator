# Series Calculator

An application that calculates when someone needs to start to rewatch the serie before the next season release.

## Setup

To configure this project in your local machine, execute the command below:

`git@github.com:marqueslu/series-calculator.git`

After that, open your local folder and execute the command `npm install` or `sudo npm install` if you are using linux.

This command will install all the packages that this application depends on.

## Running the application
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

------------

Obs. The API is returning some release dates as 'Invalid date', so the application will not do the calculation for this series.
This only happens with the series 'Young Sheldon'.
